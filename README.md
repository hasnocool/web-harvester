**WebCrawler: A PyQt5-Based Web Harvester**
=====================================

**Project Title:** WebCrawler
-----------------------------

A simple yet powerful web crawler built using PyQt5, designed to extract data from websites and save it to a CSV file.

**Description:**
---------------

Are you tired of manually copying website data? Do you want to automate the process and focus on more exciting tasks? Look no further! I built this to make web harvesting easier, faster, and more efficient. With WebCrawler, you can:

*   Explore websites with ease
*   Extract relevant information from web pages
*   Save your findings to a CSV file for further analysis

**Features:**
-------------

### Key Features

*   **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive PyQt5-based GUI makes it easy to input website URLs, set crawling depths, and select filters.
*   **Flexible Filtering**: Define URL filters using regex-like syntax to exclude unwanted pages from the crawl results.
*   **Progress Monitoring**: Track the crawler's progress in real-time through a live console output window.

### One Cool Feature: **Stop and Resume**

Want to stop the crawler mid-crawl or resume it later? No problem! Simply click the "Stop Crawling" button, and WebCrawler will save your progress. When you're ready to continue, just restart the crawler with the same settings.
